-=>Basic Chat Setup<=-

Folder:
cust_serv_chat      -(directory 755) 
cust_serv_chat/chat -(chat directory 777)

Files included:
-chat.cgi         -main chat code
-chatbar.cgi      -user/customer chatbar
-chatbar_a.cgi    -admin chatbar

(Chmod all the cgi files 755)


NOTE: If the path to perl is not /usr/bin/perl then you will need to edit
each of the cgi files and change the first line to your perl path.

NOTE: If your server requires cgi files to be located in your cgi-bin
directory, you will have to do some additional setup.
The chat directory cannot be inside the cgi-bin directory. So create the
chat directory outside the cgi-bin directory and edit bc_chat.cgi and
change the $chatpath and $chaturl variables to where the chat directory is.
